## Stacks

Stacks are lists of elements with the restriction that insertion and removal can only be performed from one place, the top of the stack. Thus, the stack is considered to be of LIFO type: last-in-first-out.

### ArrayStack

Similar to arraylist, however insertions and deletions can only be done at the top of the stack
